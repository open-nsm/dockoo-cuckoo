# Dockoo Readme

Dockoo-cuckoo is based on [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org), but it uses Docker containers rather than VMs for analysis.  Like Cuckoo, there's both a web interface and a REST API.  We will have some development information in our [Wiki](https://github.com/open-nsm/dockoo-cuckoo/wiki/Dockoo-Cuckoo-Wiki)

## Installing and Running Dockoo
Dockoo is being developed for OSX and Linux, but could potentially run on Windows as well with Boot2Docker.  There will be more information about installing and running Dockoo as the development continues.
